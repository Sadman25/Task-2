# Task-2

Pandas is a very useful python library for data analysis. My assignment was to do the following tasks with the given data using Pandas:

Data: 

{‘weekday’: [‘Sun’, ‘Mon’, ‘Tues’, ‘Wed’, ‘Thurs’,],

‘city’: [‘Dhaka’, ‘Dinajpur’, ‘Sylhet’, ‘Khulna’, ‘Chittagong’], 

‘visitors’: [139, 237, 326, 456, 759], 

‘signups’: [6, 12, 3, 5, 4]}

 
1. Write it in a CSV file.
2. Read it again and print it in the head of a data frame.
3. Print only the second to the fourth row and the third to the fourth column from the data frame.
4. Find the maximum visitor value and print the row.
5. Find the mean of signups and print the row
